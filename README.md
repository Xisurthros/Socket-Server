# Socket-Server
Python Socket server for LAN

This is a very basic server.
Its main use is to send commands to the server.

This is made for LAN use, however if you want to connect to this server from WAN you will need to look into port forwarding and change in the app portion of this project where to connect to.

I have an app able to connect to this server if you would like.

Just a warning the app is very very ugly. All it does is allow you to send strings to the server.
